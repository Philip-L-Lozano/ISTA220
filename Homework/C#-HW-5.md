1. A Compound Assignment Operator combines arithmetic operators together with assignment operators 
to shorten the syntax.

2. Compund Assignment Operators:
	- variable *= number;
	- variable /= number;
	- variable %= number;
	- variable += number;
	- variable -= number;
	
3. int X += 5;  int x = x + 5;
int y -= 50; int y = y-50;

4. While loops run without end as long as some condition is true. 

5. The iterator (loop) variable is the variable which stores a portion of the iterable when the 
for loop is being executed. Each time the loop iterates, the value of the iterator variable will 
change to a different portion of the iterable.

6. The loop will run forever becuase its value will never change and it will never meet its conditions.

7. There are 3 parts to a *for* statement (initialization, Boolean, and update). Any of these 
3 parts can be omitted, in which case Booleans will default to *True* and the loop will run forecver. 
If the Initialization and update parts are omitted, it essentially becomes a while loop. 

8. In order for a loop to run at least once, it must meet its initialization criteria.

9. You can use a break statement to jump out of the body of an iteration statement. When you break
out of a loop, the loop exits immediately, and execution continues at the fi rst statement that
follows the loop. Neither the update nor the continuation condition of the loop is rerun.

10. the continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately 
(after reevaluating the Boolean expression).

11. Infinite loops presumably would have useful impact in cryptopraphy or maybe in providing some sort 
of pace or clock function.
